`react-native-router-flux` is a different API over `react-navigation`. It helps users to define all the routes in one central place and navigate and communicate between different screens in an easy way. But it also means that `react-native-router-flux` inherits all [limitations](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/limitations.html) and changes from updated versions.

### IMPORTANT NOTES
#### v4.1.0-beta.x is based on [React Navigation v3.x](https://reactnavigation.org/)
#### v4 is based on [React Navigation v2.x]. See [this branch](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux/tree/v3) and [docs](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux/blob/master/README3.md) for v3 based on deprecated React Native Experimental Navigation API. It is not supported and may not work with latest React Native versions.

#### v4.0.0-beta.x is based on [React Navigation v1.5.x](https://reactnavigation.org/). See [this branch](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux/tree/v4.0.0-beta) for this version. It is also not supported and may not work with the latest React Native versions.

## Usage

Define all your routes in one React component...

```js
const App = () => (
  <Router>
    <Stack key="root">
      <Scene key="login" component={Login} title="Login"/>
      <Scene key="register" component={Register} title="Register"/>
      <Scene key="home" component={Home}/>
    </Stack>
  </Router>
);
```

...and navigate from one scene to another scene with a simple and powerful API.

```js
// Login.js

// navigate to 'home' as defined in your top-level router
Actions.home(PARAMS)

// go back (i.e. pop the current screen off the nav stack)
Actions.pop()

// refresh the current Scene with the specified props
Actions.refresh({param1: 'hello', param2: 'world'})
```

## API

For a full listing of the API, [view the API docs](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux/blob/master/docs/API.md).

## Try the [example apps](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux/tree/master/examples)

```bash
# Get the code
git clone https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux.git
cd react-native-router-flux/examples/[expo|react-native|redux]

# Installing dependencies
yarn

# Run it
yarn start
```

## v4 Features
* Based on latest [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org) API
* Separate navigation logic from presentation. You may now change navigation state directly from your business logic code - stores/reducers/etc. navigationStore
* Built-in state machine (v3 `Switch` replacement)
  * Each `Scene` with `component` defined can have `onEnter`/`onExit`/`on` handlers.
  * `onEnter`/`on` handler can be async.
  * For 'truthy' return of `onEnter`/`on`, `success` handler (if defined) will be executed
    * if `success` is a string then router will navigate to the `Scene` with that key
  * in case of handler's failure, `failure` prop (if defined) will be run.
  * Combining `onEnter`, `onExit`, `success`, and `failure` makes patterns like authentication, data validation, and conditional transitions simple and intuitive.
* [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/)-friendly: all scenes are wrapped with `observer`. You may subscribe to `navigationStore` (`Actions` in v3) and observe current navigation state. Not applicable to Redux.
* Flexible Nav bar customization, currently not allowed by React Navigation:
https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/issues/779
* Drawer support (provided by React Navigation)
* Inheritance of scene attributes allow you to avoid any code/attribute duplications. Adding `rightTitle` to a scene will apply to all child scenes simultaneously. See example app.
* Access to your app navigations state as simple as `Actions.state`.
* Use `Actions.currentScene` to get name of current scene.

### Helpful tips if you run into some gotchas

## Using Static on Methods with HOCs
* This is just a helpful tip for anyone who use the onExit/onEnter methods as a static method in their Component Class. Please refer to this link https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html.

* If your Scene Components are Wrapped in Custom HOCs/ Decorators, then the static onExit/onEnter methods will not work as your Custom HOCs will not copy the static methods over to your Enhanced Component.Use the npm package called hoist-non-react-statics to copy your Component level static methods over to your Enhanced Component.

## Implement onBack from your Scene after declaring it

* If you have a Scene where in you want to make some changes to your Component State when Back button is pressed, then doing this 
```js
<Scene key={...} component={...} onBack={()=>{/*code*/}}/>
``` 
will not help.

```js
<Scene key={...} component={...} onBack={()=>{/*code*/}} back={true}/> 
```
Make sure back = true is passed to your scene, now in your Component's lifecycle add this

```js
componentDidMount(){
    InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions(()=> {
        Actions.refresh({onBack:()=>this.changeSomethingInYourComponent()})
    })
}
```

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
